    <h1>KAPOW</h1>
    <p>Growing up my family had a tradition of gathering to our living room and crowding the television, no matter the sport. Although, not all were my favorite to watch but I found it was still fun to sit and be with my family, when excitment filled the room and the sounds of cheering and hollering bounced off the many wall in our home. I didn't know much of how the game of rugby or football operated but mindlessly watched and mindlessly tried to copy the hightened energy in the room. The first time I felt the gust of extreme exhiliration on those occassions and my shouts weren't mindless but genuine was the first time I saw gloved fighters exchnage blow after blow in a fight of will and precision.</p>
    <p>After that night my heart burned with a fire I never felt before. Any chance I could join my dad to watch a new up-and-coming fighter, a fighter of our ethnicity, or simply a good fight between unkown fighters, I would. My dream is to watch a UFC and One Champion fight in person and especially to watch my favorite fighters of all time; Rodtang Jitmuangnon and Canelo Alvarez. I also want to become a skilled boxer myself and be able to move and fight with the same zeal and effort as those I watch on the screen.</p>
