        <h1>Theresa Tuia</h1>
        <p>Growing up I watched UFC and MMA with my dad. I love watching combat sports and love the atmosphere it creates in the crowds around the ring. I have a favorite boxer, but he is not in the UFC or MMA. He is a One Champion fighter, named <em>Rodtang Jitmuangnon</em>.</p>
        <p>I recently got into boxing on my own. I think Muay Thai is really fun and interesting, this is mostly influenced by my favorite fighter, Rodtang. My friend who is a skilled kickboxer teaches me behind the Science Building in the evenings. We have a lot of fun sparring and conversating. Boxing brings me a lot of <strong>joy</strong>.</p>
        <p>When Boxing I make sure to pack the following in my duffle bag:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Boxing Gloves</li>
            <li>Water Bottle</li>
            <li>Shin Protectors</li>
            <li>Mouth Guard</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Rodtang said the following:</p>
        <blockquote>"In all sports, you have victories and defeats. Muay Thai is a sport that teaches us to learn and to grow as people. It shows us what it means to experience both victory and defeat, and teaches us how to forgive". </blockquote>
        <h2>-Rodtang Jitmuangnon</h2>
        <p>All in all, I'd like to say I love to watch and experience boxing more than I like to breath &amp; eat sometimes (this is an exaggeration, of course)</p>
