            <h3> what is the root? What is the relationship between folder and file names and the path?</h3>
            the root of my website is "Projects-TheresaTuia". the relationship between folder anfd file name and the path are that they are all connected and help the computer read and find where to retrieve your website from.
            <h3>What is a default document?</h3>
            a default document is the document is "index.html" allows you to navigate your folders; makes it so you  don't have to navigate in folders
            <h3>Expalin the difference between an absolut link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</h3>
            an absolute link leads your user to an outside source from your website; it has a different domain. Your relative link would bea link to your own source; it has the same domain. Relative links are more convinent and if you change your domain it would still be easily accessible.
            <h3>List the 3 rules with relative links.</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If in the same folder ou can link your relatives by calling href and putting your file name inside of double quotes "".</li>
                <li>When outside of your folder, to access you put the name of the foler and then the name of the file</li>
                <li>the start over rule, if you start a link with a slash you start back at the root (you have to modify and put things back on, like your GitHub)</li>
            </ol>
         </p>
         <h2>Relative</h2>
         <a href="Engagementactivity.html">Engagement Activity</a>
         <h2>Link to my last project!</h2>
         <a href="projects"></a>
         <a href="profile.html"> My Profile Page!</a>
         <h2>Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</h2>
         <p>Links don't always have to be in your nav, although when they are in the nav they should lead to other pages inside of your folder</p>
