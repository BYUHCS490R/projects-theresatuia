            <h3> what is the root? What is the relationship between folder and file names and the path?</h3>
            the root of my website is "Projects-TheresaTuia". the relationship between folder anfd file name and the path are that they are all connected and help the computer read and find where to retrieve your website from.
            <h3>What is a default document?</h3>
            a default document is the document is "index.html" allows you to navigate your folders; makes it so you  don't have to navigate in folders
            <h3>Expalin the difference between an absolut link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</h3>
            an absolute link leads your user to an outside source from your website; it has a different domain. Your relative link would bea link to your own source; it has the same domain. Relative links are more convinent and if you change your domain it would still be easily accessible.
            <h3>List the 3 rules with relative links.</h3>
            <ol>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
            </ol>
